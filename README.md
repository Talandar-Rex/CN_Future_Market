# CN_Future_Market
- Programs for Chinese future market.
- The usage of these codes includes trading, analysis and visualization.
- These scripts can be run on platforms like TBQuant3, WH6, WH8, etc.
- This whole code collection is aimed at beginners like myself, and only for the purpose of study.
- Be cautious! Do not apply any of my programs directly in your live trading without thorough research!
- By the way, my coding skill is somewhere near the entrance level, so, maybe you will find my work looks like garbage.
- Therefore, I decide to name all my scripts with a "junkyard_" prefix, haha!
